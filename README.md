# FastFunds



## Introduction


- Fast Funds is an application which basically connects a lender with the borrower who is in need of loans, in short it acts 
like a P2P lending app but it's not completely about lending or borrowing money, to make it stand out from other applications 
we came up with social point of view where donations can be requested for a good cause. With the help of our website an organization who is in need of funds can request for a donation. 
    
- In the loan section if a borrower need loans he/she can view the list of all the lenders in our website.
A borrower needs to upload identity proofs,bank statements and signed agreement which will be auto generated once 
the borrower requests a loan to the lender, then the lender can verify those documents and accept the borrower's request.
A Lender can be benifitted by earning a side hussle income and , a borrower can get instant loans 
and also as this is a p2p lending application, small amount of loans can also be requested.
